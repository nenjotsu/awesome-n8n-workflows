# Welcome to my collection of AI-powered n8n workflows! 🚀

![](assets/img/banner.jpeg "Photos by n8n")

This project is a curated hub of ready-to-use workflows for AI automation — from simple utilities to more advanced pipelines. Some workflows are built by me, while others are adapted from open-source projects across GitHub (credit goes to the amazing community).

## Each workflow comes with:

📂 Categories — making it easier to find what you need.

🔍 Search & Filter — via a dedicated workflow index page
 (URL here) where you can browse by category or use case.

🌐 Direct URL Links — each workflow has its own page with instructions and usage notes.

Whether you’re just experimenting or looking for production-ready automations, you’ll find something here to explore and enjoy.
